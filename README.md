# GiphyGrabber
A fun app for grabbing animated gifs using the Giphy API

# Technologies used
* JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, Giphy API, and Materialize.css

# Description
* As a die-hard fan of animation, I've selected some of my favorite shows as buttons to display a selection of gifs, using the Giphy API

* Each button will generate 10 animated gifs for that show title

* The rating of the gif is displayed for each

* Upon rendering, the gifs will be static. When clicked on, they'll switch to their animated state, and switch to static when clicked again

* An input is provided to the user to add their own titled button

* When the new button is added, it too can be clicked on and populate 10 gifs based on the input
